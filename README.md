# pamde - declarative wrapper for pacman
## The pamde philosophy
Pamde is not a package manager, it is a philosophy - a way of life. \
The idea is to track your system in a file to ensure no bloat enters its way into your system. \
Pamde is not a replacement for pacman but an enhancement. You install a pacman package,
then when you run `pamde -s` you are given a choice to either cement it in your installation
or remove it. This reduces bloat in your system, a wet dream for any arch user.
## Usage
To use the script you must first create a config file for it \
A config can be autogenerated by the script if it doesnt exist \
The config syntax looks like this:
```ini
# regualar line comments
!include foo.list # inlines the file 'foo.list'
package1          # declares package1
package2 package3 # declares package2 and package3
```
Once the config exists you can run the script:
```
Usage: pamde [options] (file)
Options:
  -s       Sync (add/remove)
  -c       Cleans up unused packages
  -u       Use AUR
  -q       Quiet mode
  -d       Dry run
  -f       No confirm (Scary!)
  -p       Profile
  -h       Display this help message
 --add     Add packages
 --remove  Remove packages
(file) defaults to /usr/local/share/pamde/main.conf
```
A common usage would be `pamde -scu` to clean and sync with aur
## Installation
`install.sh` will copy the script to `/usr/local/bin` and create a symlink
```shell
git clone https://github.com/salakksson/pamde.git
cd pamde
./install.sh
pamde -S # create default config (optional)
```
