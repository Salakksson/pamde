# pamde - declarative wrapper for pacman

## Usage:
To use the script you must first create a config file for it \
A config can be autogenerated by the script if it doesnt exist \
The config syntax looks like this:
```ini
# regualar line comments
!include foo.list # inlines the file 'foo.list'
package1          # declares package1
package2 package3 # declares package2 and package3
```
Once the config exists you can run the script:
```
pamde [options] (file)
Options:
  -r       Remove packages
  -a       Add packages
  -d       Only show diff
  -c       Show common packages
  -f       No confirm (Scary!)
  -q       Quiet mode
  -u       Use AUR
  -h       Display this help message
(file) defaults to /usr/local/share/pamde/main.conf
```
for example, `pamde -rad` would show all changes if `pamde -ra` was run
